The Bristol Stage Technicians' Association (STA) has provided an integrated ticketing and sales platform for performing arts groups at the University of Bristol for over 10 years. With the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in the absense of performances for much of the the academic year, a small team of developers, including Cobalt Grid, re-built the site from the ground up using modern languages and practices.

Nuxt.js (A Vue framework) was used to power the frontend, with a GraphQL Django-powered backend providing the functionality and interface with the database. The system integrates all aspects of the ticketing and publication of performances to a professional level:
- Paperless QR code tickets
- Seamless customer booking experience
- Integration with Square and their range of POS devices for smooth in-person and online purchases
- Fully-featured box office suite, allowing for either a mobile device to quickly check in tickets via the camera or for a kiosk-based terminal to scan with a standard QR code scanner.
- Powerful administration panel to allow groups to manage their productions
- Generation of a range of finanical and performance reports
