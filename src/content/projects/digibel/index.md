The second product in the Digiscreener series of applications, DigiBel is the sister application to the [DigiVis visual testing application](/project/digivis). Designed during the Coronavirus pandemic to provide a cost-effective solution to test hearing thresholds in non-clinical settings such as schools and residential care settings, all that is required is an Apple iPad and a pair of approved headphones.

The software comprises of two tests: a quick screening test that checks the patient can hear different frequency tones at the average hearing threshold, and a longer threshold test that accurately finds the patient's threshold using a staircase algorithm, providing a useful middle ground to allow stakeholders such a nurses and parents to identify any decline in hearing performance and where necessary seek the advice of an audiologist to perform a more in depth evaluation.

The test is designed to allow people with little-to-no training to perform and administer the test, featuring a childâ€™s mode with rewards for progress throughout the test, a clean and intuitive UI and built in button-mashing detection and background noise level detection to provide result assurance.

DigiBel successfully demonstrated conformity to gain status as a CE-marked Class I medical device, with development being conducted and maintained according to the IEC 62304 standard.
