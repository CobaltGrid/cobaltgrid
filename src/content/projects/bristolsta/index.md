Bristol Stage Technicians' Association (STA) is one of the oldest student societies at the University of Bristol's Students Union. With the added difficulty of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the society's ability to attract new members, it was decided to overhaul the old website and create a fun and engaging online presence to showcase the society to potential members, as well as those interested in collaborating with the society by hiring equipment or putting on a show.

As a member of the society, Alex and a small group of other volunteers upgraded the outdated hosting infrastructure to more modern, secure standards, and then set about designing a brand new look for the site, powered by the flexible and feature-rich Wordpress content management system.
